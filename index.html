    <p>Algae are defined as a group of predominantly 
    aquatic, photosynthetic, and nucleus-bearing organisms
    that lack the true roots, stems, leaves, and 
    specialized multicellular reproductive structures of 
    plants. Their photosynthetic pigments are also more 
    varied than those of plants, and their cells have 
    features not found among plants and animals.</p>
